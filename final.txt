TextID analysis
Florence Lin and Annette Chang

For our two contrasting text models we will use the first chapter of Hunger Games and Divergent (Dystopian). This will be our base text that will be compared to our two other "test texts"
Our two other test texts will be the first chapter of Harry Potter (Fantasy) and Percy Jackson (Fantasty).
Our goal is to analyze which dystopian chapter is more similar to Fantasty
We will run our comparison of our two "test texts" against our two trained models.

Train1 = Hunger Games
Train2 = Divergent
Test1 = Harry Potter
Test2 = Percy Jackson
